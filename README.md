# Trip-based-modelling-of-fuel-consumption-in-modern-fleet-vechicle
This project focuses on trip-based fuel consumption modeling for modern fleet vehicles using real-world trip data. By analyzing various driving parameters such as speed, acceleration, route characteristics, and vehicle-specific factors, we aim to develop predictive models that estimate fuel consumption efficiently.
